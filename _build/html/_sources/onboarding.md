## Steps
1) Read the lab manual.
2) Complete [TCPS 2 training](http://tcps2core.ca/welcome) in order to be added to our human ethics protocol. Once completed, let Hyosub know so he can submit an amendment to the ethics board for approval. 
3) Send Hyosub a photo (best if .jpg or .png and square dimensions) of yourself and short bio so he can add you to the [lab website](https://ccmlab.org/). 
4) Go to the lab [reading list](reading-list) and start reading the review article by Kim, Avraham, and Ivry (2021), and the first 20 pages of the review on motor learning by Krakauer et al (2019).  
5) Check out the [Resources](resources) page and start teaching yourself to code and any other necessary skills for your project.
