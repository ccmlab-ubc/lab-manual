# Resources

## Math
- NYU's [Math Tools for Neural and Cognitive Science](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/math-tools/) is an amazing course covering linear algebra, regression, linear systems theory, and probability and statistics
- [Mathematical Tools for Neuroscientists](https://ebatty.github.io/MathToolsforNeuroscience/intro.html) is also supposed to be an excellent course and seems to adopt a similar approach as the NYU Math Tools course.

## Programming, Data Science, and Research Code
- The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) is the easiest way to install Python together with the most popular science packages (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas). 
- Programming and Data Science for Kinesiology ([textbook](https://hyosubkim.github.io/datasci-for-kin/intro.html), [course materials](https://github.com/hyosubkim/datasci-for-kin-student)) 
- [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html) by Patrick Mineault
- [Matlab for Psychologists](http://www.antoniahamilton.com/matlab.html) by Antonia Hamilton is a good introduction to Matlab programming.

## Modeling
- [Bayesian models of perception and action](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/bayesianbook.html) is the only textbook of its kind. If you want to learn to model behavior, read this book. 
- [Neuromatch Academy](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) provides a great set of resources (Jupyter notebooks, video lectures, slides, etc.) to learn about modeling, machine learning, and computational neuroscience. 

### Git and GitHub
- Software Carpentry's [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) provides a thorough introduction to using git and GitHub.
- The online book [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) is a great resource for best practices in science. In it is a helpful [chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html) on version control. 

### Unix Shell
- Software Carpentry's [The Unix Shell][https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/] is a complete introduction to the command line.

## Statistics
- [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath
- [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis]((https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/home?authuser=0) by John Kruschke
- For a deep, but accessible, dive into Bayesian theory, watch [Aubrey Clayton's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfKS69cIwHc&list=PL9v9IXDsJkktefQzX39wC2YG07vw7DsQ_) where he walks the viewer through E.T. Jaynes's [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) 

## Reading
- [How to Read a Scientific Article: The QDAFI Method of Structured Relevant Gist](https://osf.io/5gxme) by Pascal Wallisch provides a systematic way of reading, and *remembering* research articles (at least the most important bits).

## Writing
- [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) has reached classic status at this point.
