3) Add yourself to eligible list of RISe researchers "by emailing the following information to RISe Support(risesupport@ors.ubc.ca): Full Name (Including Middle Initial), Department (or affiliation with the University), UBC Rank, Email Address, Phone Number and UBC employee number (if applicable). Once an account is created, new users will receive their researcher numbers via email."
4) Once your RISe account is created, let Hyosub know so he can add you to our study protocols. 
5) Send Hyosub a photo (best if .jpg or .png and square dimensions) of yourself and short bio so he can add you to the [lab website](https://ccmlab.org/). 
6) Go to the lab [reading list](reading-list) and start reading the review article by Kim, Avraham, and Ivry (2021), and the first 20 pages of the review on motor learning by Krakauer et al (2019).  
7) Check out the [Resources](resources) page and start teaching yourself to code and any other necessary skills for your project.
