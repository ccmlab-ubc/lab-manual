# Welcome!

Welcome to the Computation, Cognition, and Movement Lab! This lab manual was written with you in mind: it's here to help you onboard and get oriented to the lab and the work that we do. It is also meant to provide some helpful tips on how to best use your first few days/weeks/months/years in the lab. 


If you're new to the lab, please read through the entire "book". Let me know if you have any questions and how I can help.

<!-- As of November 2023, this is a work in progress. You are all invited to contribute to this manual, so that we, and future lab members, always have a guide to refer to when trying to figure out how to recruit participants, organize our project files, get reimbursed for conference travel, etc.  -->
