# Lab Philosophy

**Note:** This is currently a work in progress. More updates to come soon. 

## The Big Picture

Scientific research can be extremely rewarding, but it does come with a large set of challenges. A helpful strategy to develop early on (and one that I continue to work on) is to learn to focus on, and appreciate, the process of *doing* science. No matter whether an experiment goes to plan, or a manuscript or grant gets rejected, there is still a great deal of satisfaction to be derived from applying your mind to a tough question and learning something new, or simply seeing an experiment through so that you can design a better one. Of course, this is easier said than done, especially when you're a student and you *need* to hit some benchmarks. And results matter, too! But if you're persistent, rigorous, and thorough, it's just a matter of time until you do start to see the fruits of your labor, both in terms of interesting results as well as improvements in your scientific skills and knowledge. 

Understanding of a given topic advances due to informal conversations, through writing and reading articles, and communication between scientists at conferences; and a lab makes meaningful strides when a small collective of individuals works together with the common purpose of making new discoveries and the shared goal of helping to make those around themselves better.  

In order to achieve these goals, the following principles are ones that should guide us:

- Work honestly and with integrity
    - Avoid shortcuts
    - Put forward our best effort on every task/problem/project 
    - Follow [Richard Feynman’s advice][4]: “You must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.”     
&nbsp;
- Be diligent and proactive
    - Think deeply about our projects
    - Own our individual and group projects and ask questions during one-on-one meetings, lab meetings, seminars, etc.  
    - Volunteer to present our work, speak at seminar/lab meetings, lead journal club discussions  
&nbsp;  

- Be critical, especially of our own work, but in a constructive and friendly manner
    - Continuously question assumptions and think through the validity of a hypothesis/method/result
    - When providing critiques, be helpful by focusing on solutions more than problems 
    - Admit mistakes - we all make them and, no matter how painful they are, we learn from them  
&nbsp;

- Be good scientific citizens
    - Practice [Open Science][5]
        - Be clear about what is hypothesis-driven versus exploratory at all stages of a project
        - Share all data and code associated with manuscripts online through GitHub/OSF
        - Pre-register studies when feasible
    - Try our best to stay up-to-date on the literature
    - Support our lab mates/colleagues/peers
    - Volunteer to give talks and be an advocate for science

**Expectations and Responsibilities**

- **Principal Investigator Hyosub Kim** is expected to: 
    - Support everyone in the lab scientifically, professionally, and financially
    - Be available in person and via email or Zoom on a regular basis and have regular meetings to discuss your research and other topics of interest
    - Provide timely feedback on project ideas, conference abstracts, grants, manuscripts
    - Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers, promoting your work, writing recommendation letters, and supporting your attendance at conferences to help you prepare for the next phase of your career  
&nbsp;


- **PhD students** are expected to: 
    - Develop your dissertation research – in order to defend, you should have at least 3 substantial chapters/manuscripts that answer a big picture question
    - Be able to work independently, with guidance from Hyosub
    - Help mentor undergraduates in the lab
    - Present your work regularly at lab meetings, seminars, and conferences
    - Apply for scholarships/grants
    - Think about what you want for your career and communicate with Hyosub about making sure you are on the right path
    - Prioritize your research – coursework, TA-ships, and extracurricular activities are all important, but your research is what earns you your PhD and advances your career   
&nbsp;


- **Undergraduate students** are expected to:
    - Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis
    - Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your graduate student mentor(s)
    - Come in every week and commit enough time to get work done
    - If you are earning course credit, you must also attend lab meetings (as your schedule permits), present at 1 lab meeting, and submit a write-up of your research work by end of the semester  
&nbsp;


- **Lab managers** are expected to:
    - Help new lab members adjust to the lab by answering their questions to the best of their abilities or directing their questions to Hyosub
    - Maintain IRB protocols for the lab with help from PhD students, archive old consent forms, keep any required paperwork up to date and organized
    - Help oversee hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate research assistants
    - Help maintain and manage the lab’s OSF page, manual, calendars, Dropbox, and e-mail account (kimlab.studies@gmail.com)
    - Assist with the recruitment and scheduling of participants, including patients
    - Assist lab members with data collection and analysis 

*Thanks to [Mariam Aly][1], [Gunnar Blohm][2], and [Wei Ji Ma][3] for sharing their lab philosophies online, as having their thoughts on how to lead a lab served in many ways as a template and inspiration for this page. In particular, the **Expectations and Responsibilities** section borrows heavily from Mariam Aly's lab manual.*
