# Onboarding

## Make sure you are added to our ethics protocol
All lab members must first complete [TCPS 2 training](http://tcps2core.ca/welcome) in order to be added to our human ethics protocol. Once completed, let Hyosub know so he can submit an amendment to the ethics board for approval. No one is allowed to collect data until they are officially approved. 

## Recruiting participants
- Email
- Flyers

## Testing participants
- Consent forms:
    - There should be plenty printed out and in the testing room
    - Let Hyosub know if we are running low, so he can print more out

## Paying participants


## Readings
Check out the lab reading list and start with the review articles by Kim, Avraham, and Ivry, and Krakauer et al. 

## Send Hyosub a photo of yourself and short bio so he can add you to the lab website
Best if you can crop your photo to be square.
