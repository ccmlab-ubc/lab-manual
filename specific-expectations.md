# Specific Expectations

## Work Hours
I generally expect all of us to either be in the lab or (occasionally) working somewhere nearby on campus during normal work hours (M-F; 9-5). This is not a rigid rule, but more a guiding principle, as I know there are times when you may find working elsewhere, like the library, more productive. I also understand that an occasional change of scenery can provide a nice boost in motivation or just help clear the cobwebs. These statements are all true for me as well. However, it's best if most of our hours overlap with each other, as this will facilitate scheduling, promote serendipitous conversations, and foster community. When in doubt about what's best practice, talk to me. 

What's most important during your working hours is the depth of your attention and focus on the task at hand. How to best direct your efforts, minimize distraction, and maintain focus is something I've thought and read an awful lot about. While there's still a lot of room for improvement, I'm happy to provide any guidance I can to you around this topic. 

On the topic of focus and deep work, since we're currently sharing Dr. Romeo Chua's lab space, we have to be extra conscientious about not holding conversations in the lab. Do not to disturb the other trainees in the lab. You can take your conversations to the "closet" or the lower level. Please bring it to my attention if there are issues around distractions in the lab. 

## Lab meetings
We have weekly 1.5 hour lab meetings. Everyone is expected to attend and, more importantly, participate. We'll usually set aside time at the beginning of the meeting to catch up on everyone's projects. Each week, a different member will lead the meeting. Most weeks, we'll alternate between project discussions and journal clubs. However, we'll also have dedicated weeks for practice talks for conferences, and other science-related topics, such as best practices for coding, peer reviewing each other's writing, and other ideas that members come up with. 

## One-on-one meetings
I am here to mentor you and provide guidance. As such, you can expect to have regular one-on-one meetings with me. For graduate students, these meetings will take place weekly. For undergraduates, you can expect a regular meeting with me at least once a month. For everyone, you can always request a meeting with me and I will oblige. And please feel comfortable knocking on my office door if you have an urgent question or matter to discuss. 

I expect you to come to our meetings prepared. This means knowing what you want advice on and having a simple presentation prepared---whether slides, written notes/documents, or whiteboard sketches. There are several projects constantly floating around in my brain, not only yours, so please help me so that I can provide you with my best possible advice. I also expect you to follow through on agreed upon actions and next steps. 

## Receiving feedback on work
I believe one of my strengths as an advisor is providing thoughtful feedback. This does take time and effort. When looking for feedback on anything, provide me with sufficient lead time. 

- Several weeks for first draft of conference abstract
- Start early on manuscripts
- Proposals and theses

## Principal Investigator: Hyosub Kim
I aim to provide an overall vision for the lab (see [Mission](#mission)) and collaboratively work with you to make sure our research is rigorous, thorough, and clearly communicated (see [Guiding Principles](#guiding-principles). Through our collaborative research efforts, I will also work hard to help you realize your potential and successfully reach the next stage of your career. You are in the lab because I believe in you and want to work with you. 

Other specific expectations of the PI: 
- Support everyone in the lab scientifically, professionally, and in the case of graduate trainees, financially
- Be available for regular meetings to discuss your research and other topics of interest
- Provide timely feedback on project ideas, conference abstracts, grants, manuscripts
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers, promoting your work, writing recommendation letters, and supporting your attendance at conferences to help you prepare for the next stage of your career  

## Graduate students
You are the driver of your research project. While I (Hyosub) may provide you with a concrete idea for your first project in the lab---and I'm always here to provide guidance---you are always the project leader. Practically speaking, this means you should: 

- (PhD students) Develop your dissertation research. In order to defend, you should have at least 3 substantial chapters/publishable manuscripts that answer a big picture question
- (Master's students) Develop your thesis research. In order to defend, you should have at least 1 substantial chapter/publishable mansucript that answers an important question
- **Prioritize your research**. Coursework, TA-ships, and extracurricular activities are all important, but your *research* is what earns you your degree and advances your career 
- Be able to work independently, while also seeking guidance from the PI
- Help mentor undergraduates in the lab. All graduate students are expected to mentor/work with 1-2 undergraduates. 
- Present your work regularly at lab meetings, seminars, and conferences
- Apply for scholarships/grants
- Maintain human ethics approvals, archive old consent forms, keep any required paperwork up to date and organized
- Think about what you want for your career and communicate with Hyosub about how to accomplish your goals
  
## Undergraduate students
While the PI will meet with you regularly and advise you on your project, you will likely receive more direct day-to-day guidance from one of the graduate students in the lab. If you are completing an undergraduate research experience (e.g., KIN 492), capstone project, or senior thesis, you are expected to be the driver of your project. Understanding that your timeline is compressed (either one or two terms), the scope of your project will be significantly smaller than that of a Master's student's. Also, while publication of your project is nowhere near out of the question, it is not a firm expectation as it is for all graduate students. If you are earning course credit, you are also expected to attend lab meetings (as your schedule permits), present at at least one lab meeting, and submit a write-up of your research work by the end of your project. 

For all undergraduate volunteers, the expectations for you are the following:
- Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis
- Assist with recruitment and scheduling of participants
- Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your graduate student mentor(s) and Hyosub
- Come in every week and commit enough time to get work done


## Lab manager/Research assistants
As a paid employee, you are expected to perform a series of tasks and duties that are assigned to you by the PI. You are also responsible for keeping track of your hours and what you spend those hours working on. Specific responsibilities include assisting with, maintaining and/or developing standard operating procedures around the following:
- Setting up behavioral experiments
- Participant recruitment and payment
- Onboarding new lab members
- Data collection and analysis
- Obtaining and maintaining ethics approvals
- Data and code curation
- Upkeep of lab notebooks
- Overall project management
- Keeping lab website up-to-date 

Although you have a more concrete set of day-to-day responsibilities than the trainees in the lab, I also want to provide you with opportunities to learn more about research. You are encouraged to attend lab meetings and participate in all of our discussions. If you are sincerely interested in our research *and* you have a good handle on all of your other responsibilities, as a rule of thumb, you can spend up to 20% of your work hours on research-related actiivites, which includes participating in lab meetings. However, this sort of flexibility is subject to change depending on how pressing lab-related maintenance is during any given period.
