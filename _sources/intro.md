# Welcome!

Welcome to the Computation, Cognition, and Movement (CCM) Lab! This lab manual was written with you in mind. For new members, it will help you onboard and get oriented to the lab and the work that we do. For seasoned veterans, it should serve as a useful reference that you can return to. 

Let me know if you have any questions and how I can help.

<!-- As of November 2023, this is a work in progress. You are all invited to contribute to this manual, so that we, and future lab members, always have a guide to refer to when trying to figure out how to recruit participants, organize our project files, get reimbursed for conference travel, etc.  -->
