# Onboarding

You can find out about onboarding steps, SOPs regarding running experiments and data and code management, and a whole lot more in our private [lab wiki](https://osf.io/qbze9/). New CCM Lab members should request access to the wiki from our lab manager.

## Steps
1) Read the lab manual.
1) Submit an Issue (click on Octocat in upper right) regarding the lab manual---i.e., provide a suggestion, comment, or raise a question. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account in order to do this, so if you don't have one, create one. 
1) Accept eventual invitation to join CCM Lab organization on GitHub. 
1) Complete [TCPS 2 training](http://tcps2core.ca/welcome) in order to be added to our human ethics protocol. 
1) Add yourself to eligible list of RISe researchers "by emailing the following information to RISe Support(risesupport@ors.ubc.ca): Full Name (Including Middle Initial), Department (or affiliation with the University), UBC Rank, Email Address, Phone Number and UBC employee number (if applicable). Once an account is created, new users will receive their researcher numbers via email."
1) Once your RISe account is created, let Hyosub know so he can add you to our study protocols.
1) Provide lab manager with your contact info (UBC email, CWL, gmail address, phone). The first two are required to grant you access to the lab email. The lab manager will put in a request to our IT person, Robert Lovin. 
1) Send Hyosub a photo (best if .jpg or .png and square dimensions) of yourself and short bio so he can add you to the [lab website](https://ccmlab.org/). 
1) Go to the lab [reading list](reading-list) and start reading the review article by Kim, Avraham, and Ivry (2021), and the first 20 pages of the review on motor learning by Krakauer et al (2019).  
1) Check out the [Resources](resources) page and start teaching yourself to code and any other necessary skills for your project.
